## Dew Drop Daily Weather

Allows modpack and server developers to control when the rain comes and goes.

With this mod you can schedule weather to change at specific times of the day, such as making mornings sunny, and evenings rainy.
You can also allow for RNG to decide what the weather should be while staying in control of how long it will last.  

By default, the weather event for the day (clear, raining, or storming), will be decided at the beginning of each minecraft day, with a 60% chance for clear weather, 20% chance for rain, and 10% chance for a storm.  
The weather will remain the same all day long, with a small chance to change during the nighttime.
